# Fight Detection
 This project explores the use of advanced object detection models for fight detection in real-world scenarios.
 YOLO-NAS, YOLOv8, YOLOv10:
These state-of-the-art models represent the cutting edge in object detection, offering a balance between accuracy, speed, and efficiency.

Real-World Uses:
Public Safety: Fight detection aids law enforcement in monitoring and quick response.
Video Surveillance: Identifies threats in real-time, triggering alarms or alerts.
Content Moderation: Filters violent content on social media and video platforms.
